# Analyze A/B Test Results (web page)

In this project, A/B test is performed to study a new web page developed by a company to increase the number of users converted(who purchased the new product) on new page.

The Dataset contain information on each user id and, duration, landing page(old page and new page) and whether if the user is converted. The approach is to perform the A/B test and use a Logistic Regression model to predict the probability of individuals who were converted.

### A/B Test: 
State the null and alternative hypothesis, create sampling distribution for the difference of people converted on the new page and old page, then perform hypothesis tests to analyze the relationshipe between its p-value and alpha to make decisions.
### Logistic Regression model:
Create dummies variables treatment and control columns(catogory variables) and Y-intercept, then create logistic regression model and summarize the resutls.
